\chapter{Introduction}

Currently the insurance industry is beset with redundant and poorly optimised business processes. In this paper, I will focus on the airline insurance or specifically, airline delay insurance. The current process goes like this. Once the user buys insurance from a flight, the user data is sent to an insurance company. The insurance payback amount is decided by actuary and underwriters. The claim process however is much more complex. Once applied, the claim request goes back and forth between the airline and insurance company for multiple confirmations and after an inordinate amount of time, the user finally gets the money back. What I plan to show using this paper is that the whole process can be automated and function without human supervision. There are two important aspects to achieving this goal:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Machine Learning
    \item Blockchain
\end{enumerate}

\section{Existing Work}
Even though there were none of the similar products, on 13th September 2017, insurance conglomerate launched an exactly similar product. The website is \url{fizzy.axa}. It has exactly the same features as this project. 
\section{Problem Statement}
In this paper we will go through the complete process and provide a prototype based on these concepts that shows this is possible.

\section{Objective and Limitations}
The objective of the project is automating the process plain and simple. But this is not a full fledged insurance purchasing option yet. Smart contracts are still in infancy and have not gained full legal standing yet. Similar attempts have been made to replicate this process but they have been conceptually based on cryptocurrency instead of actual currency, or the simulation in our prototype.

\section{How the objective will be achieved}
The first step in calculating the insurance rates would be automating the whole process of insurance underwriters. But in doing so we have to balance risks for the company to make sure we do not lose money. This will be achieved in a very simple way.
