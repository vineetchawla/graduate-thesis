\chapter{Introduction}

Currently the insurance industry is beset with redundant and poorly optimised business processes. As such, insurance industry is not ranked high among consumers when it comes to reputation\cite{lauraMazzucaToops2014HarrisPropertyCasualty360}. One can think of many reasons due to which the industry hasn't considered upgrading significantly, although it comes down to multiple orthodoxies prevalent in insurance industry. Many insurers have treated these orthodoxies as entry barriers effectively insulating them from being disrupted in a significant way by internal or external upstarts. They include the belief that\cite{Shaw2016InsurersDisrupted}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consumer familiarity with established insurers precludes wide-scale disruption by newcomers to the business.
    \item Insurance is often a complex, opaque, and even misunderstood product, which gives the industry’s seasoned agent and broker sales force a considerable edge over would-be alternative distribution challengers.
    \item Insurers have effectively cornered the market on the data, models, and analytical talent to underwrite and price exposures as well as facilitate risk management.
    \item Since the premise of risk pooling is fundamental to the business of insurance, the massive capital reserves assembled by insurers cannot be easily replicated by new players.
\end{itemize}

But recent changes in technology sector have woken up many companies to a possibility of disruption. Even though started as a base for bitcoin, blockchain has gained immense popularity as the next big thing with various implications to the traditional insurance industry.
\\ In this paper, the possibility of such a disruption will be evaluated. And the best way to evaluate will be to actually build such a service. The aim of this Master Thesis will be to create a product that fully exploits the plethora of innovations the technology world has seen in last decade and using them , create an insurance service that provides an efficiency and transparency standard for users that just isn't possible with current business practices. Flight delay insurance will be the main focus of this service. The end-goal of this thesis will be to create a full fledged insurance service that provides complete transparency to the buyers regarding insurance premium, payouts and claims, and automate the claim reimbursement by removing the claim process itself. This automation will be achieved via combination of Machine learning and Blockchain.

\section{Existing Work}
Even though there have been many services providing commerce applications using Blockchain, there is no particular website that provides a full fledged flight delay insurance capability. A similar project was created on Ethereum smart contract called Etherisc\footnote{\url{https://fdd.etherisc.com/} Requires an Ethereum client for functioning}. But using their insurance service needs an Ethereum client running on the user's machine and transactions are limited to Ether, severely limiting the functionality and reach of the platform.
\\On 13\textsuperscript{th} September 2017, Insurance giant AXA launched a new website called fizzy\footnote{\url{fizzy.axa} Blockchain based Flight delay insurance by AXA} that provides the exact functionality as my prototype intends to provide via this project. Fizzy calculates the insurance rates based on the booked flight details and displays them to the user before the purchase of insurance. The claim process is also automatically triggered once the flight status is available with the help of smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. The only difference of Fizzy with my project seems to be that they pay the user only when the flight is delayed more than 2 hours.

\section{Problem Statement}
Creating an automated flight delay insurance platform that provides the buyer complete transparency about insurance rates and removes the manual process of claims reimbursement. The solution will consist of four sub-tasks, independent but connected to each other.
    \subsection{Flight data}
    A dataset consisting of every single flight that landed in Germany between December to May, a six month interval. The dataset will also contain weather conditions of the airport at the time of flight landing.
    \subsection{Flight Delay prediction}
    A highly accurate prediction model for the flight delays. This model will be used in calculating the insurance payouts. If the model predicts high probability of delay, the insurance payout will be lower. If the model predicts low probability of delay, the insurance payout will be higher.
    \subsection{Blockchain}
    The legal agreement for insurance will be created with the help of Blockchain. Blockchain will provide essential requirements for an insurance platform, Time-stamping and Non-Repudiation. Due to blockchain's immutable architecture, integrity of customer data can also be ensured.
    \subsection{Website}
    A simple but secure web application that will enable a user to check out the insurance rates before purchasing, buy insurance and provide status of the insurance. There will be no claim process defined as no user input will be required for that. The claims will automatically trigger if the flight was delayed.

\section{Objective and Limitations}
The aim of the project, as already mentioned, is to create an insurance platform with modern technologies that is not possible with current business practices. But the service doesn't aim to provide any commercial services just yet. As insurance industry is heavily regulated, using technologies such as blockchain, which is not entirely regulated, would be ill-advised. This project is more of an example to show the strengths of blockchain as an insurance platform that will help and guide regulators in creating sensible guidelines and regulations for use of such technologies. The legal implications too have to fully studied and be taken into consideration before creating an insurance platform, not currently possible for blockchain
\\Another limitation is that our prediction algorithms considers only flights landing in Germany. The prediction algorithm might be lot different if flights landing in other countries are considered.
\\The website created being a prototype, there will be no transfer of money. The transactions necessary for prototype functionality will be simulated. For ex., by default it is assumed that the user pays 10€ for buying the insurance and the payouts shown to the user for different delays will be based on the insurance amount of 10€. The claim process will also email the user about insurance amount they will be payed using Emails, but never actually transferred any money.
