\chapter{Introduction}

Currently the insurance industry is beset with redundant and poorly optimised business processes. In this paper, I will focus on the airline insurance or specifically, airline delay insurance. The current process goes like this. Once the user buys insurance from a flight, the user data is sent to an insurance company. The insurance payback amount is decided by actuary and underwriters. The claim process however is much more complex. Once applied, the claim request goes back and forth between the airline and insurance company for multiple confirmations and after an inordinate amount of time, the user finally gets the money back. â€¨What I plan to show using this paper is that the whole process can be automated and function without human supervision. There are two important aspects to achieving this goal:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Machine Learning
    \item Blockchain
\end{enumerate}

\section{Existing Work}

\section{Problem Statement}
In this paper we will go through the complete process and provide a prototype based on these concepts that shows this is possible.

\section{Objective and Limitations}

\section{How the objectibe will be achieved}
The first step in calculating the insurance rates would be automating the whole process of insurance underwriters. But in doing so we have to balance risks for the company to make sure we do not lose money. This will be achieved in a very simple way.
